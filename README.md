Here are some point I have a addressed for a good Landing Page Seo
1. Include a Title Tag in the page
2. Include Alt tag on the images
3. Include a clear Meta description in the page. I have keep it between 140 and 160 characters so Google can display your entire message.
4. Add internal links using appropriately targeted anchor text.
It helps search engines comprehend the context and content of te page.
5. Pay attention to the Page Speeds.

===Improve Page Speed===
1. Optimizing the code (including removing spaces, unnecessary characters, unusedcode etc)
2. Not use Redirects
3. Use content distribution network(CDN) where is possible
4. Optimize Image (use Image with right file format)
7. I have not use heavy format for images like Tiff or BMP. They are uncompressed format and will take up a lot of storage space.
8. I have not include heavy images
9. Remove render-blocking JavaScript
10. Optimise the website for Mobile
